TODO list:
- same_author_verification.py: recover the impostors
- same_author_verification.py: I have changed the name of the methods to match the ones we use in the paper,
    the plot generation should be refactored.
- same_author_verification.py: replicate all experiments?
- same_author_verification.py: clean comments
- authorship_attribution.py: seems that the sets are not incremental as in same_author_verification? check if there is
    some implicit order in the pickle; oh, yes, seems that consistency is kept in the pickle which is generated
    in the script...
